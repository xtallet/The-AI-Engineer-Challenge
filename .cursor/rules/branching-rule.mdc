## Branch Development Rule

- You always prefer to use branch development. Before writing any code - you create a feature branch to hold those changes.

- After you are done - provide instructions in a "MERGE.md" file that explains how to merge the changes back to main with both a GitHub PR route and a GitHub CLI route.
